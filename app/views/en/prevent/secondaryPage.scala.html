            <div class="text-title">What is secondary prevention?</div>
            <div class="text-body">Secondary prevention, also known as pre-clinical prevention, refers to the early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment of the disease in the pre-clinical stage of "three early" prevention, to control the development and deterioration of the disease, prevent the recurrence of the disease or become chronic. </div>

            <div class="text-title">The core of secondary prevention</div>
            <div class="text-body">The core of secondary prevention is early diagnosis.The premise of early diagnosis is early detection, early diagnosis can be treated early, so as to improve the prognosis.To do secondary prevention well, it is necessary to publicize the knowledge of disease prevention to the masses, improve the diagnosis and treatment level of medical personnel and establish a sensitive and reliable disease surveillance system. </div>
            <div class="text-body">At present, most of the causes of many chronic diseases are unknown, so it is impossible to completely achieve primary prevention. Due to the relatively long time of occurrence and development of chronic diseases, early detection and early treatment are feasible, such as cervical cancer, coronary heart disease, hypertension and so on.Early detection measures include screening, screening, regular health check-ups and the establishment of specialist clinics.General survey is a comprehensive method for early detection of diseases, but it should not be widely used because it requires a large amount of manpower and material resources in a short period of time.Screening is the main method of early detection, but the principle of screening should be considered when deciding whether to screen for a disease.Some tumors can also be detected early by self-examination of the population, such as breast self-examination can be early detection of breast cancer.Some precancerous lesions are easy to develop into cancer, such as mucosal white spots and chronic skin ulcers are easy to develop into skin cancer, cervical erosion is easy to develop into cervical cancer.The detection and early treatment of various precancerous lesions belong to the secondary prevention of tumors.Prenatal examination found fetal chromosomal abnormalities and early diagnosis, and then terminate pregnancy, belong to genetic disease secondary prevention.  </div>
